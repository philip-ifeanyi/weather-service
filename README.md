# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project,
The OpenWeather api was used to get the weather data, we also used the oneCall endpoint
Tailwind CSS was used for the styling
Luxon.js waas used for formatting the datetime
The Icons in the project were gotten from the openweather api and IconScout.
Toastify.ts was used for the alerts.

I learnt how to handle API, although it really issn't my strong suit. I didn't use any library to call the api or handle data.
This is a pure learning experience for me.
I learned Tailwind CSS, and tailwind is beautiful btw, just saying.
I learned the useEffect hook and useState hook, I look to learn more about these technologies... howw best to learn, but to build more projects...
